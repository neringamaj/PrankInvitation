Hi! This program will create a small invitation to New Year's party.

How to create one:
	1. Open "main.c" file and compile it.
	2. In IDE the UI will tell you what info is needed and will ask to write in the name of the file where that info is.
	3. If you choose so, IDE isn't needed, you could compile it through Command Line by entering:
		gcc main.c -o main-exe
	4. If the file exists and isn't empty, it will create HTML file "index.html" and txt file "list.txt".
	5. Open "index.html".

Good luck!
